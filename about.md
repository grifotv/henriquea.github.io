## Ola! I'm Henrique Alves, Frontend Engineer passionated about user experience design and user interfaces.

I love visual design and I care how the product feels for the user. I like the web, product design, football, black tea and cold weather.

I built my first website in 1999 and 2002 I joined a small digital studio. Until 2012 I developed micro sites for brands including Nike, Coca-Cola, Samsung and Olympic.

I met amazing and talented people during this time. Also have worked with different technologies from Processing to WebGL and openFrameworks.

In 2012 I left the industry to build products through companies and startups.

Four simple principles I like to follow when building products:

- Collaboration
- Craftsmanship
- Simplicity
- Flow

I'm living in London, England with my wife and two daughters. Currently working at
[Lystable](http://lystable.com). My previous work experience also includes [RBS](http://www.rbs.co.uk),
[PayPoint](http://paypoint.com), [Hailo](http://hailoapp.com), [The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk), [B-Reel](http://b-reel.com) and
[Possible](http://www.possible.com).

Interested in make the web a better place for desktop, mobile and other platforms. I see the web outside the browser as general-purpose display and interaction engine.
