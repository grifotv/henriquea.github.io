## Ola! I'm Henrique Alves, Frontend Engineer passionated about user experience design and user interfaces.

I love visual design and I care how the product feels for the user. I like the
web, product design, football, black tea and cold weather.

I built my first website in 1999 and 2002 I joined a small digital studio.
Until 2012 I developed micro sites for brands including Nike, Coca-Cola,
Samsung and Olympic Games.

I met amazing and talented people during this time. Also have worked with
different technologies from Processing to WebGL and openFrameworks.

In 2012 I left the industry to build products through companies and startups.

Four simple principles I like to follow when building products:

- Collaboration
- Craftsmanship
- Simplicity
- Flow

I'm living in London, England with my wife and two daughters. Currently working
at [Lystable](http://lystable.com). My previous work experience also includes
[RBS](http://www.rbs.co.uk), [Hailo](http://hailoapp.com),
[The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk), [B-Reel](http://b-reel.com) and
[Possible](http://www.possible.com).

Interested in make the web a better place for desktop, mobile and other
platforms. I see the web outside the browser as general-purpose display and
interaction engine.
