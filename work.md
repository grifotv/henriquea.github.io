## Times Collection &mdash; Building a content builder for tablet and mobile

It was aimed to answer the question: "How to enable journalists to create and publish beautiful stories without involve the team?"

After two similar projects for the Sunday Times, I proposed the creation of a tool using the code base of these projects and avoid the burn of repeat ourselves.

I led the initial design phase working closely with Nicola Ryan on concept, UX and wireframing. Then Kyle Wheeler assumed the project as designer doing a gorgeous work. Since the beginning we aimed the simplicity and elegance, focusing on types and photography. Nick Petrie did an amazing work talking with journalists, gathering the right content and making sure that all stakeholders would understand its values and prepositions.

I did the Django backend and front-end development as well choosing Ember.js as main framework.

The latest project is "My Lives" describing the ten most influential lives in their specific fields available on tablet edition.

_TASKS_ UX, Django backend, Ember.js frontend app
