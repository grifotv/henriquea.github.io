Before say yes for a three days feature 🙏 bare in mind:

- The two hours sprint planning session
- Time spent on GitHub answering comments and writing PRs
- Time spent writing documentation, tests and figuring out why the heck Selenium isn't working
- Time spent looking at animated gif cats in the #random channel
- You haven't slept well last night. You're a millennial and think that sleeping is for old people
- Disruptions in your commuting
- That two hours pub lunch on Friday

Better time estimation will lead to less fatigue and high quality work hour. Big win for your fellow team mate who’s going to dig your pretty code while you’re off in Barcelona.
