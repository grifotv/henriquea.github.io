In the past year I had the opportunity to work in small, medium startups and big enterprise companies. In both places I met amazing talented people.

Often you can hear the conversation around **“move fast and break things"**.

It’s like a competition to see whom delivers more features in less time. This rush in getting things done is harming business, users and burning out good people.

We love build products and the craftsmanship around each feature. Nobody wants to delivery crappy features. All we want is to delight the users, make their life simple and easy.

## A better place

In 2016 I’d like to see: less broken things, less burnout and less negativism. I’d love to see more places shipping less features with great user experience. Let's build a culture of healthy and sustainable development environment.
